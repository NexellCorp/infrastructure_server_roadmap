Important Notice
----------------

To run the configuration, it is necessary to:
 - Rename the file secrets.yml.local in secrets.yml
 - Update it with with the correct credentials

The secrets.yml file contains variables for:
 - Crowd user name and password
 - Jira user name and password
 - A list of paths to local files necessary for Apache SSL configuration

 Not providing those values will result in the playbook not being applied or
 in the application not being installed correctly.

 Note: if the playbook is executed without those variables, the values on the
 server will be lost!! Do not run the playbook if you do not have those values.

 Executing the Ansible Playbook
 ------------------------------
 
 This is a "special" setup: we have two domains, hosted on the same machine.
 Since the ansible steps are executed for each domain, we cannot execute them
 all at the same time.

 It is necessary to first run it for one domain, and then for the other. There
 can be errors on the package installation, since it needs exclusive lock.

 To execute the playbook, from the ansible folder:

 ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml -l status.linaro.org

 and then for the other domain, roadmap.linaro.org.

 Performing an Update
 --------------------

 To perform an update of the code on the server:

 ansible-playbook -i hosts update.yml -l status.linaro.org

 It is possible to pass an extra variables to identify the git checkout or tag
 to use to update the code:

 ansible-playbook -i hosts update.yml -l status.linaro.org -e git_tag=$TAG

 By default the value of 'git_tag' points to HEAD.
